# AMS Puppet

The AMS Puppet app will fetch all jobs from the Data/IT section from `ams.se`. All job ad's can be fetched and saved as json without Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is needed to export the json files. All example diagrams are from Kibana.

## Options

* `--get` The get option is used to fetch all job links from the ams site.
* `--set` The set option check if a json file with the job id exist. If not it will fetch the json file from the ams site.
* `--exp` Will export all json files to Elastic search.
* `--all` Get, set and export all ad content

## Config

If we add a `puppeteer.json` file in the config folder we can make some configuration. We can set values for `headless` and `executablePath`. The `executablePath` can be used if we want to use a different browser than Chromium like Google Chrome.

``` json
{
    "headless": false,
    "executablePath": "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
}
```

If we add a `elasticsearch.json` file in the config folder we can set what node elasticsearch is listening to and what the index name is.

``` json
{ 
    "node": "http://127.0.0.1:9200",
    "index": "ams"
}
```

## Installation

``` bash
$ npm install
```

## Dependencies

### Elasticsearch

https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch

``` bash
$ bin/elasticsearch
```

Test Elasticsearch

``` bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9200
```

By default Elasticsearch will use an index called elastic and guess the mapping. This will become a problem when displaying the jobs on a map since the geo points arent added correctly. There is a alternativ mapping in `docs/elasticsearch.md`. Use the Kibana Dev tools console to add this mapping.

### Kibana

https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana

``` bash
$Â bin/kibana
```
When Kibana is started it will display what url Kibana can be accessed from.

``` bash
Server running at http://localhost:5601
```

When Kibana is running the data can be displayed in different types of diagrams.

To display the geo points correctly go to the Kibana dev tools console. Then copy paste the commands from `docs/elasticsearch.md` into the command promt. This will add a `index` called `ams` and the mapping for the index. Since we are using a different index name then the deafult `elasticsearch` name we need to add a `elasticsearch.json` config file. Create a file called `elasticsearch.json` in the config folder and add the following.

``` bash
{ 
    "node": "http://127.0.0.1:9200",
    "index": "ams"
}
```
